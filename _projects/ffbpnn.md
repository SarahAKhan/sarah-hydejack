description: >
  This floatation device was our team's submission for the MATE Floats task of the 2024 MATE ROV Competition.  It performs fully automated vertical profiles consisting of sensor temperature, depth, and pressure data collection, and subsequent transmission upon profile completion.  The data received on deck is automatically written to a csv file and plotted in the float device's controls GUI.
