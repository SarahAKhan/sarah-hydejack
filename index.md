## Hello!
Thank you for visiting my site!  My name is Sarah Khan and I am an MSCS grad student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics.  I'm interested in robotic deployment in home environments for assistive tasks and assistive technology in general.

Projects related to graduate research and academic involvement can be seen here in the Academics section:
