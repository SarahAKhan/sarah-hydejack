  Foothill College and Stanford Digital Education have an ongoing collaboration centered on integrating the extensive Code in Place educational platform into Foothill College's introductory CS49 course.  In support of this effort as a Section Leader, I presented at Learning Lab's INSPIRE Convening 2024 Conference on that integration and the innovative academic impact these efforts have had on enabling students to enter into the Computer Science field.

## Co-Presenter at Learning Lab's INSPIRE Convening 2024 Conference

## Project Overview
Foothill College and Stanford Digital Education were invited to present on their Code in Place integration at the INSPIRE Convene 2024 Conference, organized by Learning Lab.  The conference hosts multiple California higher education institutions and serves as an educational think tank on academic innovation and challanges.

I was invited to co-present on Foothill College's behalf, as I have been functioning as a Section Leader in Foothill College's iteration of Code in Place since its inception. I co-presented with Matthew Rascoff, Vice Provost of Stanford Digital Education and Eric Reed, Department Chair of Foothill College Computer Science in the "Leveraging Technologies Designed for Equity - Powered By Humans!" learning track in a presentation entitled, "Scaling Success: How Code in Place is Revolutionizing Computer Science Education".

We presented on the Code in Place platform and educational ethos, which is to enable and support students from varied backgrounds to enter into the Computer Science field.  Highlighting the flexible open source Code in Place platform, we demonstrated how the established course was adapted to Foothill College's CS49 curriculum requirements, resulting in a transferrable, credit granting course with an extensive web based learning environment.  

I presented on my role as a Section Leader for the Foothill College iteration of Code in Place, which involves collaboration with Foothill teaching staff and Stanford Digital Education, providing students with weekly instructional support and guided programming challenges.

## Collaborations

In preparation for the conference, I was tasked with the presentation deck development.  I collaborated with both schools' faculty to develop the presentation content and organization, interviewing and consolidating all critical perspectives.
