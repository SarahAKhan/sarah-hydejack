    Richard hails from Tulsa.
    He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!)
    Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
    While his work focuses on applied information theory,
    mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
    his non-work interests range widely,
    everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
    He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!
