## Volunteer Merch Product Developer for Manjeet Sarkar

## Overview
Manjeet Sarkar is a rising standup comedian in the Indian standup community, well known for his social commentary on discrimination against marginalized groups in South Asian communities.  I was inspired by his outspoken and acute delivery on these topics, and so while enrolled as a fulltime Computer Science student, I contributed to his efforts by leveraging the years of design experience I had accumulated thus far.  This opportunity allowed me to design in a capacity that aligned more with my values and general outlook.  I designed graphics for his upcoming tour to be used on merchandise to raise funds for expanding said tour.
