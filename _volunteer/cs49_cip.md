## Foothill CS49/Code in Place Section Leader

## Program Overview
From Spring 2024 Foothill College and Stanford Digital Education have been collaborating on integrating Stanford's online learning platform and course, Code in Place, into Foothill College's curriculum.  This effort has resulted in the current iteration of Foothill College's CS49, a remote transferrable credit granting introductory computer science course.

## Section Leader
I have volunteered as a Section Leader since the course's inception in Spring 2024 and continue to do so presently.  Code in Place emphasizes the impact of the "human touch" in remote learning and Section Leaders exist to provide a sizeable portion of that.  They meet with a sub-group of students on a weekly basis and provide additional instructional support on the curriculum along with oversight on weekly programming challenges.  

The programming challenges provide students with an opportunity to collaborate with their cohorts on developing solutions to problems related to their current lecture topics.  Section Leaders guide the group through the challenges, providing critical insights into developing student programming practices and theory.  

## Technical Curriculum
Code in Place students begin their programming journey in Python and cover the following wide array of topics:

 - Control Flow
 - Stepwise Refinement
 - Expressions
 - Functions
 - Graphics
 - Animation
 - Data Structures

## Community Impact

Code in Place serves as a gateway into the Computer Science field for many non-traditional students.  Being a non-traditional student myself, I gratefully accepted the opportunity to support others in similar circumstances in their efforts to gain increasingly critical programming skills.  It provides me with the chance to put the knowledge I've gained in my own career shifting journey to good use.  As a Section Leader, I function as an educator and a mentor, and thrive on watching students realize their own tenacity and potential in crafting their own tech inspired futures. 
 
## Educational Involvement & Skills

Having completed two quarters as a Section Leader, I have contributed a sizeable library of presentation materials to the Code in Place instructional library.  Section Leaders are provided with ample resources for conducting each Section, and so to further contribute to this extensive effort, I developed additional section materials derived from those resources.  

This role has enabled me to grow my own instructional skills in a profound way.  I regularly request student feedback on how I can bring more value to our Section meetings, and learn as much from the students as they do from me.
