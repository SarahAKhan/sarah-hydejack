    Richard hails from Tulsa.
    He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!)
    Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
    While his work focuses on applied information theory,
    mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
    his non-work interests range widely,
    everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
    He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!

    startDate: "2024-08-14"
    endDate: "2024-12-14"
    description: >
      This project aims to develop a knowledge distillation framework for TinyML applications
      that use time series data. The goal is to reduce the size of the model while maintaining
      high accuracy and performance. The project will involve training a large model on a
      time series dataset and then distilling the knowledge into a smaller model that can be
      deployed on resource-constrained devices.
